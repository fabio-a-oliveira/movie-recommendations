### Important instructions:

* This is a large repo. It contains all the predictions from a number of different models. It will take some time to clone.
* If you intend on looking at the .pdf, .RMD and .R files, you can simply copy and open them any way you want.
* **If you intend on knitting the report**, be advised that it needs to have access to the results from the .R script, so you need to either: 1) clone the entire repo, including all the files in the \results folder or 2) run the main script yourself, so it can create the models, calculate the predictions, and save them locally.
* **If you intend on running the main script**, be advised that it may take up to 5-6 hours to run.
